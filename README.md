# Pattern-Guide
A simple prototype tool using a coded pattern library.
  
## Goals 
- Simple & Fast prototyping tool
- Based around atomic design
- Wireframe level of fidelity
- I'm thinking of looking codeing out atoms, element, modules etc... acording to atomic design theory. I should be able to take those patterns and quickly mock up a rough page for any give web project.

## Ideas
- could I use a templeting language like mustache?
- Each new project would be a subdomain: client.pattern-guide.com

## Inspiration
- http://patternlab.io
